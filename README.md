# Angular examples
This project has been created with the angular CLI, please make sure to familiarize yourself with it if you haven't used it before, visit https://github.com/angular/angular-cli for more information

This playground is mainly here to demonstrate core Angular concepts: modules organisation, components re-use, communication between components, dependency injection, observables, structural and attribute directives, reactive forms, global state...etc. Those examples are not fully functional applications, they are just interesting from a code point of view and be easily extended. I will keep adding more examples regularly.
